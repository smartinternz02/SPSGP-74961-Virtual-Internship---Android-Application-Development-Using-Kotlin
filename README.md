# Android-Grocery-Application-Shoppy--
This Application was built as an assignment of google supported virtual internship provided to me by smartinternz platform. The task was to build an application using kotlin and android studio which helps users keep the list of grocery items to be purchased by the users. To understand the problem this user-friendly application solves let us consider the following situation, "Many people just forget what items they wanted to buy and how much quantity they wanted to buy when they go to shopping ", In that scenario 'SHOPPY' comes into action and helps solve this problem easily by using built-in functionality and user-frienldly UI.

# About App
This application helps users to remember the list of grocery items they need to buy. Additionaly it also calculates the total price of each items by getting the price of individual items and total number of items. Shoppy uses Room database to store and fetch the list of grocery items . It has a user friendly UI design and is very helpful in shopping as it spports the creation and deletion of the items. As it uses Room database , the data remains untouched even after the user quits the application.
